    "## Utilizing Llama 3.2 90B for data extraction on images for distillation to fine tune Llama 3.1 8B (Build-your-own OCR Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk you through the process of utilizing a Llama 3.2 90B model to leverage its vision and text extraction capabilities to create an instruction fine-tuning dataset to perform distillation by fine-tuning a Llama 3.2 11B model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Llama 3.2 90B's vision capabilities, we can leverage advanced vision models for text extraction from images, improving the process of creating a robust OCR solution. Here are a few significant advantages to leveraging vision models for structured documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Structured Information Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional OCR, where solutions capture text as flat string, vision models can identify specific field like \"Employer Name\" or \"Wages\" and export them in a labeled format (e.g JSON) directly. This avoids additional processing steps needed to interpret unstructured OCR text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Enhanced Field-Level Accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision models can be fine-tined to recognize specific fields with high precision. For instance, a fine-tuned vision model can reliably differentiate between 2 fields within a bounding box, whereas OCR might capture them as generic text that requires additional parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Improved Handling of Variability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision models are better at handling document variability (e.g different layouts, fonts, or minor distortions) without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Semantic Understanding / Contextual Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision models trained to extract and label fields can group information meaningfully, making it easier to convert it into structured datasets for analysis or fine-tuning text-based models. Traditional OCR lacks this semantic understanding and would require post-processing pipelines to achieve similar structured output."

With this notebook, we have successfully leveraged llama 3.2 90b with a one-shot prompt to create an instruction-based dataset that we can use to fine-tune 11b with to perform distillation to enhance the accuracy of responses with 11b."
