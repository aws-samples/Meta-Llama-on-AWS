    "# Frugal Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Meta Llama models: Preference aligning LLMs with Multi-Adapter PPO\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/Llama.png\" width=\"30%\" alt='Llama.png'/> \n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will guide you through the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with a multi-adapter Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "1. Set up the necessary environment and dependencies\n",
    "2. Prepare datasets for both reward model training and PPO fine-tuning\n",
    "3. Train a reward model using human preference data\n",
    "4. Perform PPO-based RLHF training using your reward model\n",
    "5. Deploy the fine-tuned model to both Amazon SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock for inference\n",
    "6. Clean up resources\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on LLM fine-tuning, benefits of reinforcement learning approaches like RLHF and the benefits or multi-adapter PPO can be found in [this blogpost](https://medium.com/data-science/preference-alignment-for-everyone-2563cec4d10e). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the models published these days have already gone through multiple fine-tuning steps like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or even preference alignment (PA), since these models are general purpose ones they where certainly not performed tailored to your target users or target domain. This means that even though we are using a pre-aligned model (e.g. an instruction fine-tuned model), for optimising model performance in your domain further alignment steps are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop we will assume the model should be optimised towards maximising the helpfulness for a user while carrying out user-facing single- and multi-turn conversations in a Q&A style in the scientific domain. Thus, as a base model we will pick  a general-purpose instruct / Q&A pre-trained FM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) account (or use your existing one).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accept the license terms for [Meta Llama 3.1 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) and [Meta Llama 3.2 1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) Instruct models on HuggingFace. Therefor navigate to the respective model pages through the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/LlamaLicenseAgreement.png\" width=\"30%\" alt='LlamaLicenseAgreement.png'/> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an access token for HuggingFace authentication. Therefor please follow the instructions from the [HuggingFace documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).\n",

    "- Meta Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct: More powerful but requires more compute resources (training with ml.g5.12xlarge)\n",
