# Amazon SageMaker Llama3 Prompting Best Practices

This repository contains the accompanying notebook and data required to demonstrate prompting best practices with Llama3 using SageMaker Jumpstart. Notebook uses Llama3 8B paramater model.

## Using this code

Clone this repository in your SageMaker Studio notebook and run the notebook. Please note this notebook will deploy Llama3-8B model to `g5.12xlarge` instance. You will need to update Service Quota to be able to deploy the instance in the region as an endpoint.

This notebook can be run on a simple t3.medium instance using the Data Science 3.0 kernel. Both the endpoints and the studio notebook will incur costs. Please delete the endpoints and stop the notebook instances if they're not being used to avoid getting charged.
