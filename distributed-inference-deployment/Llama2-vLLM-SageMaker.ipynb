    "[Llama 2](https://llama.meta.com/llama2/) are pretrained models trained on 2 trillion tokens with a 4k context length. Its fine-tuned chat models have been trained on over 1 million human annotations. Llama 2 has undergone internal and external adversarial testing across fine-tuned models to identify potential toxicity, bias, and other gaps in performance.

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we combine the strengths of two powerful tools: [DJL](https://docs.djl.ai/) (Deep Java Library) for the serving framework and [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) for distributed large language model inference. DJLServing, a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by DJL, handles the overall serving architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup, vLLM handles the core LLM inference tasks, leveraging its optimizations to achieve high performance and low latency. DJLServing manages the broader serving infrastructure, handling incoming requests, load balancing, and coordinating with vLLM for efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows us to deploy the `Llama 2 7B` model across GPUs on the `ml.g5.12xlarge` instance with optimal resource utilization. vLLM's efficiencies in memory management and request handling enable us to serve this large model with improved throughput compared to traditional serving methods. To learn more about DJL, DJLServing, and vLLM you can refer to this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/boost-inference-performance-for-mixtral-and-llama-2-models-with-new-amazon-sagemaker-containers/).\n",

   "source": [
    "Here is a list of settings that we use in this configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HF_MODEL_ID`: The model id of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repository on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/models). The container uses this model id to download the corresponding model repository on huggingface.co. This is an optional setting and is not needed in the scenario where you are brining your own model. If you are getting your own model, you can include the URI of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the model.\n",
    "- `HF_TOKEN`: Some models on the HuggingFace Hub are gated and require permission from the owner to access. To deploy a gated model from the HuggingFace Hub using LMI, you must provide an [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) via this environment variable.\n",
    "- `OPTION_ENGINE`: The engine for DJL to use. In this case, we intend to use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) and hence set it as **Python**.\n",
    "- `OPTION_DTYPE`: The data type you plan to cast the model weights to. If not provided, LMI will use fp16.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TGI_COMPAT`: To get the same response output as HuggingFace's Text Generation Inference, you can use the env `OPTION_TGI_COMPAT=true`.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TASK`: The task used in Hugging Face for different pipelines. Default is text-generation. For further reading on DJL parameters on SageMaker, follow the [link](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/user_guides/deepspeed_user_guide.html)\n",
    "- `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH`: Enables continuous batching (iteration level batching) with one of the supported backends. Available backends differ by container, see [Inference Library Configurations](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/deployment_guide/configurations.html#inference-library-configuration) for mappings.\n",
    "    - In the LMI Container:\n",
    "        - to use vLLM, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=vllm`\n",
    "        - to use lmi-dist, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=lmi-dist`\n",
    "        - to use huggingface accelerate, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=auto` for text generation models, or option.rolling_batch=disable for non-text generation models.\n",
    "- `TENSOR_PARALLEL_DEGREE`: Set to the number of GPU devices over which DeepSpeed needs to partition the model. This parameter also controls the no of workers per model which will be started up when DJL serving runs. Setting this to `max`, which will shard the model across all available GPUs. As an example if we have a 8 GPU machine and we are creating 8 partitions then we will have 1 worker per model to serve the requests.\n",
    "- `OPTION_DEVICE_MAP`: The HuggingFace accelerate device_map to use.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`: If the model artifacts contain custom modeling code, you should set this to true after validating the custom code is not malicious. If you are using a HuggingFace Hub model id, you should also specify HF_REVISION to ensure you are using artifacts and code that you have validated.\n",

      "1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and salt until well combined.\n",
      "2. Slowly pour in the oil while continuously whisking the mixture. You can do this by hand with a whisk or use an electric mixer on low speed.\n",
      "3. Once you've added about half of the oil, add the vinegar or lemon juice and continue whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies. This should take about 5-7 minutes.\n",
      "4. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the mayonnaise is too thick, add a little water. If it's too thin, add more oil.\n",
      "5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mayonnaise sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the mayonnaise to thicken further.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! You can use this basic recipe as a starting point and adjust the seasonings to suit your taste preferences. Some common variations include adding a little bit of Dijon mustard for a tangier flavor or some chopped fresh herbs for added flavor and color. Enjoy!\n"
