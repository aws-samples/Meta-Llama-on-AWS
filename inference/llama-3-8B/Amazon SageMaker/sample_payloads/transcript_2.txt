# Call transcript:
Customer: I'm extremely frustrated! My credit card was declined at the grocery store and I know I have money in my account!
Agent: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Let me look into this immediately. Can you provide me with the last four digits of your card?
Customer: It's 4567. This is embarrassing and unacceptable!
Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Davis. Let me check your account... I see the issue. There was a security hold placed on your card due to unusual spending patterns detected by our fraud protection system.
Customer: What unusual patterns? I've been shopping normally!
Agent: I see several transactions in different states over the past two days - one in California, then Texas, then back to your home state. Our system flagged this as potentially suspicious.
Customer: Oh... I was on a business trip. I used my card at airports and hotels.
Agent: That makes perfect sense. I can remove the security hold right now and your card will be active again within 15 minutes. I'll also add a travel note to your account.
Customer: Okay, but this shouldn't happen again. I travel frequently for work.
Agent: Absolutely. I'm setting up a permanent travel profile on your account. You can also call us before trips to pre-authorize travel. Would you like me to send you information about our mobile app where you can do this yourself?
Customer: Yes, that would be helpful. And I want to make sure this hold is completely removed.
Agent: The hold is removed as of right now, and I'm sending the app information to your registered email. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: No, that should do it. Thank you for fixing this quickly.
Agent: You're welcome, Mr. Davis. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a great day!
