# Call transcript:
Customer: Hi, I'm calling about my internet connection. It's been really slow for the past week.
Agent: Good morning! I'm sorry to hear about the slow internet. Let me help you with that. Can I get your account number please?
Customer: Sure, it's 789456123.
Agent: Thank you. I see your account here, Ms. Johnson. Let me run a diagnostic on your line... I can see there's been some congestion in your area due to construction work.
Customer: Oh, that explains it. When will it be fixed?
Agent: The construction should be completed by Friday, and we expect speeds to return to normal by then. However, I can offer you a temporary speed boost at no charge until then.
Customer: That would be great, thank you.
Agent: Perfect. I've applied the boost to your account. You should see improved speeds within the next hour. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: Actually, yes. I've been thinking about upgrading my plan. What options do you have?
Agent: Excellent! We have several upgrade options. Your current plan is 100 Mbps. We offer 300 Mbps for an additional $15 per month, or our premium 1 Gig plan for $30 more.
Customer: The 300 Mbps sounds good. Can you set that up?
Agent: Absolutely! I can process that upgrade right now. The new speed will be active within 24 hours, and the new rate will appear on your next bill.
Customer: Perfect. Thank you so much for your help.
Agent: You're very welcome, Ms. Johnson. Have a wonderful day!
