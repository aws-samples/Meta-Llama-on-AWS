    "# Advanced Prompt Engineering for Meta Llama 3\n",

    "\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well with the **`Python 3`** kernel in SageMaker Studio on **`us-west-2`** region*\n",

    "## What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "Prompt engineering is an emerging discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently adapt language model to various tasks. By using various prompt engineering techniques, you can often get better responses from the foundation models (FM) without spending efforts and resources on finetuning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple advanced prompt engineering techniques, this notebook will covers:\n",
    "1. **Few-shots example**: This technique involves providing the large language model with a few examples (normally, these can be between 3 and 5) of the desired task or output. It helps the model learn patterns from limited data, making it particularly useful when extensive datasets are unavailable. Few-shot prompting can enable the model to generalize from minimal input effectively.\n",
    "2. **Chain of Thoughts (CoT)**: This technique encourages the language model to articulate its reasoning step-by-step, which can improve transparency and understanding of the model's thought and decision making process. By breaking down complex problems into more manageable parts, CoT prompting increases problem-solving accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Self-consistency**: This technique enhances the performance, and consistency of the language models by generating multiple outputs for the same input and selecting the most consistent answer among them.\n",
    "4. **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**: This technique combines reasoning with action by having the model generate both logical reasoning steps and specific actions to take based on those steps. This allows for more dynamic interactions where the model can adapt its responses based on ongoing interactions.\n",
    "5. **Prompt chaining**: This technique involves linking (hence, chaining) multiple prompts together to create a coherent, consistent flow of interactions. By referencing previous inputs or outputs, prompt chaining encourages deeper interactions and provides more consistent responses from language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to implement various prompt engineering techniques with **Meta Llama 3** foundation model, using the **Amazon Bedrock API** with `Boto3` client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Remark</b>: If this is your first time user, please make sure you are enable the access to Llama model on the Amazon Bedrock console.\n",
