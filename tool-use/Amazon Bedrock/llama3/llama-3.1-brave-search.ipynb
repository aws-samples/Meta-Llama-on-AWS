    "# **Function Calling with Llama 3.1 Models**\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook exploring function calling capabilities with Meta's Llama 3.1 models. Llama 3.1, the latest iteration in the Llama family, introduces native support for function calling, marking a significant advancement in the model's capabilities and potential applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Llamas](imgs/llama-pic.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What's New in Llama 3.1?**\n",
    "Llama 3.1 brings several exciting improvements:\n",
    "- Native Function Calling: Built-in support for generating structured JSON outputs that can be used with various APIs.\n",
    "- Multilingual Support: Expanded language understanding across 8 languages, including English, French, German, Hindi, Italian Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai.\n",
    "- Improved Performance: Benchmarking in the GPT-4+ class, competitive with both GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n",
    "- Increased Context Window: The 8B and 70B models now support a 128,000 token context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Function Calling Overview**\n",
    "Function calling, also known as tool use, allows Llama 3.1 to interact with external tools or APIs by generating structured outputs. This capability enables more complex, multi-step interactions between the model and available tools, enhancing its problem-solving abilities and practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Amazon Bedrock**\n",
    "![bedrock](imgs/bedrock-img.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to a wide range of powerful foundation models (FMs) through a unified API. It offers models from leading AI companies like Mistral, Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Cohere, Stability AI, and Amazon's own Titan models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified API**: Bedrock provides a single API endpoint to access different models, simplifying integration and allowing developers to experiment with or switch between models with minimal code changes.\n",
    "- **Serverless and Fully Managed**: As a fully managed service, Bedrock eliminates the need for users to handle infrastructure management, making it easier to build and deploy generative AI applications.\n",
    "- **Model Customization**: Users can customize models with their own data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- **Security and Privacy**: Bedrock offers built-in security features, ensuring data privacy and compliance with various standards. It follows best practices like encrypting all data and preventing third parties from accessing user data.\n",
    "- **Agents for Complex Tasks**: Bedrock allows the creation of agents that can plan and execute multi-step tasks using enterprise systems and data sources.\n",
    "- **Integration with AWS Services**: Bedrock can be easily integrated with other AWS services and existing applications.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: A new capability that helps customers assess, compare, and select the best model for their application.\n",
    "- **Guardrails**: Bedrock provides tools to implement safeguards tailored to application needs and aligned with responsible AI policies.\n",
    "- **Custom Model Import**: A new feature that allows customers to import and access their own custom models as a fully managed API in Bedrock.\n",
    "- **Playground Environment**: Bedrock offers Playgrounds (text, chat, and image) to compare models and experiment with different options"

    "We can use the Amazon Bedrock chat playground with Llama 3.1 70b Instruct model as a quick way to demonstrate function calling.  There are two ways of invoking function calling: one is the ```Python``` way and the other is the ```JSON``` way.  The essential difference between the two is that in the ```Python``` method, the Llama 3.1 models have been trained to recognize a small number of functions natively.  These functions are: ```wolfram_alpha```, ```brave_search``` and ```code_interpreter```.  In other words the models have been trained to recognize when they should call and how to call functions for computation, internet search and code.  They also have been trained to respond in a **zero shot** fashion to tool definitions they have not seen before.  This is the ```JSON``` method.  Both methods will be demonstrated in this notebook. "
