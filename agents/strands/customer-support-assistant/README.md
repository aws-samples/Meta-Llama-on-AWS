## Prerequisites

### AWS Account Setup

1. **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - [Create AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
   - [AWS Console Access](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

2. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure AWS CLI with your credentials
   - [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
   - [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3. **Python 3.10+**: Required for running the application
   - [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials for calendar access** : For Google Calendar integration
   - Follow [Google OAuth Setup](./prerequisite/google_oauth_setup.md)

## Deploy

1. **Create infrastructure**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

    chmod +x scripts/prereq.sh
    ./scripts/prereq.sh

    chmod +x scripts/list_ssm_parameters.sh
    ./scripts/list_ssm_parameters.sh
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Please prefix all the resource name with `customersupport`.

2. **Test Ollama with strands locally**

    ```bash
    python3 test/test_agent_local.py
    ```
    Note: It'll return the current time in San Francisco as output using tool calling

3. **Create Agentcore Gateway**

    ```bash
    python3 scripts/agentcore_gateway.py create --name customersupport-gw
    ```

4. **Setup Agentcore Identity**

    - **Setup Cognito Credential Provider**

    ```bash
    python3 scripts/cognito_credentials_provider.py create --name customersupport-gateways

    python3 test/test_gateway.py --prompt "Check warranty with serial number MNO33333333"
    ```

    - **Setup Google Credential Provider**

    Follow instructions to setup [Google Credentials](./prerequisite/google_oauth_setup.md).

    ```bash
    python3 scripts/google_credentials_provider.py create --name customersupport-google-calendar

    python3 test/test_google_tool.py
    ```

5. **Create Memory**

    ```bash
    python3 scripts/agentcore_memory.py create --name customersupport

    python3 test/test_memory.py load-conversation
    python3 test/test_memory.py load-prompt "My preference of gaming console is V5 Pro"
    python3 test/test_memory.py list-memory
    ```

6. **Setup Agent Runtime**

> [!CAUTION]
> Please ensure the name of the agent starts with `customersupport` and replae the <AgentName> with a name for example, test.
    
  ```bash
  agentcore configure --entrypoint main.py -er arn:aws:iam::<Account-Id>:role/<Role> --name customersupport_<AgentName>
  ```

  Use `./scripts/list_ssm_parameters.sh` to fill:
  - `Role = ValueOf(/app/customersupport/agentcore/runtime_iam_role)`
  - `OAuth Discovery URL = ValueOf(/app/customersupport/agentcore/cognito_discovery_url)`
  - `OAuth client id = ValueOf(/app/customersupport/agentcore/web_client_id)`.

  ![configure](./images/runtime_configure.png)

  > [!CAUTION]
  > Please make sure to delete `.agentcore.yaml` before running agentcore launch.

  ```bash

  agentcore launch

  python3 test/test_agent.py customersupport_<AgentName> -p "Hi"
  ```
Note: 
1. For the first time login, you may need to **signup** and **login** to the UI.
2. When asked for `code`, please refer to the following example, copy between `code=` and `&state` from your browser after authentication and paste as needed.

7. **Local Host Streamlit UI**

> [!CAUTION]
> Streamlit app should only run on port `8501`.
