    "### Amazon Bedrock Inline Agent Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This function demonstrates the core implementation of Amazon Bedrock inline agents, which provide serverless AI automation capabilities that can be configured and invoked dynamically at runtime without requiring pre-deployed infrastructure [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create-inline.html). The implementation serves as the central processing engine for Llama model interactions, utilizing structured prompt engineering where different analytical tasks such as department identification, summarization, and categorization are handled through operation-specific prompts that guide the foundation model's behavior to produce consistent, structured responses. Session management is implemented through unique UUID generation to enable conversation tracking and context maintenance across multiple agent interactions, while the function processes streaming responses from the Bedrock agent runtime by decoding binary chunks and combining them into complete responses with comprehensive error handling for robust production operation [[2]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service_code_examples_bedrock-agent-runtime.html). This approach leverages the interactive notebook environment's capability to maintain session state and variable tracking, allowing for iterative development and testing of agent behaviors within the managed AWS infrastructure [[3]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html).\n",

I understand the urgency of the situation, and I am committed to providing immediate assistance.<br><br>Regarding the authentication tokens expiring too quickly, I recommend that we review your token renewal settings to ensure they are optimized for your usage patterns. I will also provide guidance on best practices for token management to prevent future expirations.<br><br>To address the 503 errors during peak hours (2-4 PM EST), I suggest we schedule a call with your technical team to discuss possible solutions, such as load balancing, caching, or optimizing API requests. This will help us identify the root cause and implement a fix to prevent future errors.<br><br>Concerning the delayed webhook notifications, I will investigate our notification system to determine the cause of the delay. In the meantime, I recommend that we set up a temporary workaround to ensure timely notifications, such as polling or manual checks.<br><br>I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and I am committed to resolving these issues as quickly as possible. The impact on your transactions, customer complaints, and revenue is unacceptable, and I will work closely with your technical team to rectify the situation.<br><br>Please let me know a convenient time for the call, and I will ensure that our team is available to discuss the next steps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.<br><br>Thank you for your patience and cooperation.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Emily Lee<br>Customer Support Department<br>support@company.com<br>(123) 456-7890</div></div>"

    "## Next Steps: Expanding Your Bedrock Inline Agent with Llama Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've built a functional email processing system with Amazon Bedrock inline agents powered by Llama models, you can explore integrating additional AWS services to enhance your agent's capabilities and create more sophisticated workflows for educational experimentation. Amazon Bedrock manages the underlying complexity including prompt engineering, memory, monitoring, encryption, user permissions, and API invocation, allowing you to focus on building functionality rather than infrastructure [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring Advanced Agent Configurations with Llama Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Your inline agent implementation demonstrates the power of combining Llama's reasoning capabilities with Amazon Bedrock's managed infrastructure. The platform exposes default prompt templates for pre-processing, orchestration, knowledge base response generation, and post-processing, which you can optionally customize to modify your agent's behavior at each step of its sequence [[2]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-how.html). This flexibility is particularly valuable when working with Llama models, as you can fine-tune the prompting strategies to leverage Llama's specific strengths in reasoning and instruction following.\n",
    "\n",
    "For expanding your educational exploration, consider experimenting with action groups that define actions your agent can help end users perform, where each action group includes the parameters that the agent must elicit from the end-user [[3]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-prereq.html). You can also explore Lambda function integration, where your agent can use Lambda functions by attaching resource-based policies to provide the necessary permissions [[4]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-lambda.html). Additionally, Amazon Bedrock provides comprehensive code examples that demonstrate how to perform individual Amazon Bedrock Agents actions with AWS SDKs, offering practical implementation patterns you can adapt for your own experiments [[5]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service_code_examples_bedrock-agent_actions.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inline agent approach you've implemented provides an excellent foundation for understanding how Llama models can orchestrate interactions between foundation models, data sources, software applications, and user conversations, automatically calling APIs to take actions and invoking knowledge bases to supplement information [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html).\n",
