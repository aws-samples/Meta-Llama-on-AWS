    "This notebook introduces a versatile approach that leverages Llama 3 models on Amazon Bedrock, including advanced prompt engineering, to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. Our approach generates SQL queries capable of joining data from multiple tables, enabling information retrieval from complex database structures. This multi-table capability is crucial in real-world scenarios where data is often distributed across various tables with intricate relationships, and queries need to combine information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, our approach demonstrates high scalability through dynamically selecting and retrieving the most relevant table schemas based on the given natural language question. This scalability is achieved by employing intelligent schema matching algorithms powered by ChromaDB. ChromaDB analyzes the question and automatically identifies the appropriate tables and relationships required to construct the SQL query, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution can be applied in practical scenarios where companies manage numerous databases with intricate table relationships, such as in the finance industry for analyzing customer transactions across multiple accounts and products, or in healthcare for integrating patient records from various systems and data sources."

    "## The Approach to the Text-to-SQL Problem\n",
    "This notebook covers the following approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few-shot text-to-SQL (Single Table vs Multiple Tables)\n",
    "Few-shot text-to-SQL is an approach for querying databases by translating natural language questions into SQL queries, using only a few training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing just a few examples of natural language questions paired with the equivalent SQL queries allows models to learn the mapping from natural language to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference : https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12586\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few-shot text-to-SQL powered by ChromaDB (Schema Retrieval vs Enhance Schema Retrieval with Sample Questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leverages ChromaDB, a vector database, to assist the few-shot text-to-SQL translation process. ChromaDB can be used in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema Retrieval**: In this method, ChromaDB stores the database schema information, which includes table names, column names, and their descriptions. When a natural language question is provided, the model can retrieve relevant schema information from ChromaDB to aid in generating the SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Schema Retrieval with Sample Questions**: Building upon the previous method, this approach also stores sample natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries in ChromaDB. When a new question is given, the model can retrieve not only the relevant schema information but also similar sample questions and their SQL queries from ChromaDB. This additional context can further improve the model's ability to accurately translate the natural language question into an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging ChromaDB, the few-shot text-to-SQL translation process can benefit from efficient schema and sample data retrieval, potentially leading to better performance and generalization across different databases and query types.\n",

    "Few-Shot Learning for text-to-SQL tasks, where a language model is trained on a limited number of examples to translate natural language queries into SQL queries, faces significant limitations. One of the key challenges is selecting the appropriate table schema that aligns with the user's question.\n",

    "We can observe that ChromaDB was unable to retrieve the correct table schema for the \"airplanes\" table. The issue arose due to a confusion caused by a foreign key reference. Specifically, ChromaDB retrieved the \"flights\" table instead of the \"airplanes\" table because the \"flights\" table contains a field called \"Airplane_id\" which references the \"airplanes\" table as a foreign key. This foreign key reference led to the confusion, resulting in ChromaDB retrieving the wrong table.\n",

The data retrieval process became more accurate and reliable, ensuring that the correct table schemas were consistently retrieved, even in the presence of complex table relationships and foreign key references."
