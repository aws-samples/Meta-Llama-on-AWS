# Text2SQL using Llama 3.2

This repository provides a *Cloudformation template* to deploy a SageMaker Environment where you can explore, test, and experiment Text-to-SQL using Llama 3.2

### Prerequisites
To interact with the models, you need to [request access to the models in the region you will use](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?#/modelaccess). Make sure to read and accept the end-user license agreements or EULA.

***Note:** To make sure that you have enough quotas to support your usage requirements, it's a best practice to monitor and manage your service quotas. Requests for Amazon SageMaker service quota increases are subject to review by AWS engineering teams. Also, service quota increase requests aren't immediately processed when you submit a request. After your request is processed, you receive an email notification.*

### Instance type quota increase

Complete the following steps:

- Open the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/).
- Choose Amazon SageMaker.
- Choose the service quota.
- Choose Request quota increase.

## Deployment

The solution is deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template with Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance. To deploy the solution, use one of the following CloudFormation templates and follow the instructions below.

Per [guidance for workload isolation on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/workload-isolation-on-aws/), it is recommended that you deploy the CloudFormation template in its own AWS account.

| AWS Region | AWS CloudFormation Template URL |
|:-----------|:----------------------------|
| us-east-1 (N. Virginia) |<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=text2sql&templateURL=" target="_blank">Launch stack</a> |
| us-west-2 (Oregon) |<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=text2sql&templateURL=" target="_blank">Launch stack</a> |


This CloudFormation template launches a Sagemaker Notebook Instance and an RDS instance running MySQL to execute SQL queries using Llama 3.2. It also sets up the necessary networking infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups, and flow logs, to facilitate secure communication between the SageMaker notebook and the RDS instance.

1. Click on one of the links above to deploy the solution via CloudFormation in your AWS account. 

2. Under Prerequisite â€“ Prepare template, select Choose an existing template. Under Specify template, select **Upload** a template file. Click the **Choose file** button and select the template [deployment.yaml](cloudformation/text2sql-v3.yaml) to upload. Click **Next** to continue.

3. Set the stack name as `text2sql` and Click **Next** to continue.

5. On the next step to Configure stack options, 

    a. Leave all values as default.

    b. Under Capabilities select the checkbox box to acknowledge that the template might create IAM resources.

    c. Click **Next** to continue.

6. On the Review and create step; click the **Submit** button located at the bottom of the page to deploy the template.

7. The stack should take around 10-15 minutes to deploy. Once completed, navigate to the output tab of the stack.

8. Open the generated **SageMakerNotebookURL** Url from the cloudformation outputs above i.e. `https:<sagemaker_notebook_name>.notebook.<region>.sagemaker.aws/lab`.
