Testing involves comparing the model's responses to a set of predefined questions or tasks against the baseline performance of the original, pre-trained model. This process helps us understand the improvements achieved through fine-tuning and identify any remaining areas for enhancement. By systematically examining the model's outputs, we can ensure that the fine-tuning process has effectively tailored the model to meet our specific requirements."
